            <p class="leading-relaxed text-gray-600 text-lg pt-10">The Amber HEART Academy is a collaboration between the Government of
                Jamaica (HEART/NSTA Trust and HOPE) and the Amber Group. The initiative is the first of its kind in the
                Caribbean and will engage unattached youth across Jamaica with skills training in Software Programming
                Operations at the Stony Hill Heart Academy. The training is a one-year residential program where
                students are fully sponsored and provided accommodations, meals, equipment's and education.

                The Amber HEART Academy intends to target 4000 youth annually through the programme. Upon graduation,
                the students will be offered employment within the Amber Group and receive a Government recognized
                NCTVET certification.

                This programme is a stepping-stone for Jamaica to become the technological hub of the region.
